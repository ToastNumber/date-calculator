Date Calculator
===============
This is a javascript application for practising mental date calculation.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Learn mental date calculation [here](http://www.kinch2002.com/how-to-calculate-the-day-of-the-week-from-a-date/).
2. Visit the project site [here](http://toastnumber.github.io/date-calculator/).

How to Use
----------
1. Select the difficulty
    - `Easy` means years between 1900 and 1999.
    - `Hard` means years between 1900 and 9999.
2. Click the start button.
    - Pressing the number '8' will have the same effect.
3. By default, 10 dates are generated.
    - The number of dates generated can be changed by clicking the "Change No. Dates" button.
4. Starting with the first date, enter 0-6 (Sunday-Saturday) to answer.
5. The day you enter will be shown in the table.
    - If are you correct, the table will show "Correct!"
    - If you are incorrect, the table will show the actual answer.
6. Once you have completed all answers, the time taken will be shown.
    - The time shown is equal to the time elapsed since the start button was clicked (or since '8' was pressed).
    - If you uncheck the "Timed" box, the time will not be shown.
